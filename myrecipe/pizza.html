        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>                
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>               
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>                
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>                
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>                
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cumin</li>                
            <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>              
            <li>⅛ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>                
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make the dough: Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, shortening, and salt in a large bowl; add yeast mixture and stir until dough comes together. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste, water, salt, sugar, oregano, garlic powder, basil, marjoram, cumin, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and black pepper; simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12-inch circle. Place dough onto two 12-inch pizza pans; cover with sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
